This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setup 
Make sure you have installed `nvm` and `pnpm`.

For Next.js, Node.js version >= v18.17.0 is required.
Download node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Run the following command to check node version
```node -v```

Change the node version by running
```
nvm install v18.17.0
nvm use v18.17.0
```

## Getting Started
First, install the dependencies.
run ```pnpm i```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
